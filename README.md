Used basic MySQL knowledge for CRUD ops in NodeJS on Database

This is a Node.js project using MySQL database.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm install sql

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Some of the initial dat in the database sql file have been stored.
You can run MySQL workbench to fetch those data or do more CRUD ops on that.

However such CRUD ops are also be done by the application, the sole reason of the Application.

Enjoy :)
